This a blog maintained by the the **O**bservational **P**roducts for **E**nd-users from **R**emote **S**ensing **A**nalysis project's ([OPERA](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/)) Science Team to informally discuss the Surface Disturbance Product derived from Sentinel-1 (DIST-S1).
Sentinel-1 is the European Space Agency's C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) constellation of satellites with 6 day-repeat pass frequency.
The DIST-S1 product is derived from the near-global OPERA Radiometric and Terrain Corrected (RTC-S1) products that provide the amplitude imagery from this constellation.
We will provide interactive maps of our product over disasters, highlight features of the products, illustrate effective products use, and explore algorithm details.
